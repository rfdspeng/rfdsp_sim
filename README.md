Things to review:
* How do the different engineering teams and subsystems work together (hardware, software, systems)
* Signals and systems
    * Direct sequence spread spectrum
    * Single-carrier
    * Multi-carrier/OFDM
* DSP
    * Fixed point
    * Multi-rate processing (polyphase, resampler)
    * 
* RF circuits and systems, link budgets, impairments and compensation
* RF calibration
* Lab: sig gen, spec an, signal analyzer, net an, oscope
* Microwave/antenna, antenna gain, EM (electricity and magnetism)
* Communication theory/wireless comms
    * Communication protocol/layers
    * PHY (coding schemes, ACM/MCS, ARQ/HARQ, error rates, equalization, synchronization)
    * MAC (packet formats, PER/BLER/TBER, packet size, scheduling)
    * Network protocols
    * Throughput/traffic/latency
    * Scheduling, multi-user performance
    * Cellular theory
    * Channel: models, fading, estimation, beamforming, channel capacity, null-steering
    * Mod, demod
* 3GPP, GPS, Wifi, satellite
* Python, MATLAB
* C/C++
* GNU Radio, Simulink, ADS, Microwave Office, Ansys HFSS

Key terms:
* SDR (platforms and tools)
* FPGA
* ASIC
