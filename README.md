# Hello and welcome to my radio frequency transceiver simulation project!

Everything is a work in progress.
* Under `./notes/`, you'll find my notes on various electrical engineering topics, useful Python libraries, and Jupyter notebooks with simple examples.
* Under `./python/`, you'll find custom Python modules, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks for modeling RF transceivers. See `./python/requirements.txt` to reproduce my Python environment.
* Under `./octave/`, you'll find custom Octave modules and scripts. However, I am deprecating this in favor of Python.
