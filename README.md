# Welcome to my RF transceiver simulation project!

Everything is a work in progress.
* Under `./notes/`, you'll find my notes on various electrical engineering topics and useful Python libraries, and Jupyter notebooks with simple examples.
* Under `./python/`, you'll find custom Python modules, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks for modeling RF transceivers. See `./python/requirements.txt` to reproduce my Python environment.
* Under `./octave/`, you'll find custom Octave modules and scripts. (These are deprecated in favor of Python.)
