Transfer curve plotting
LU decomposition - customize the E inverse
Write your own matrix rank function
Numerical computation of eigenvalues
Pruning in the LU decomposition doesn't seem to work - if I switch the nonlinear orders, the pruning doesn't follow the nonlinear order. But I do remember the order of the kernels matters.
You can also try Cholesky and see if the pruning is any better
Condition number, conditioning a matrix
